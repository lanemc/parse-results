# Check Links and Parse Results

This repository contains a bash script that runs broken-link-checker and subsequently parses the results into a csv and/or index.html file that can be displayed using a web server. It was specifically built to be used with https://math.umn.edu; however there are opportunities to extend and refactor for flexibility which will be discussed in a later section.
